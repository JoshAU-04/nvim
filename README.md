# Neovim Config

This is a neovim config that I made.


## Features

 * Plugins are managed by lazy.nvim
 * The terminal is assumed to be transparent so most non-default colorschemes have complete transparency support.
 * Comes with an installer script.
 * Probably not broken but you never really know.

## Plugin Manager

The plugin manager I've elected to use is lazy.nvim because:

 a) It's modular, and
 b) I'm lazy

### Plugins

 * Lspconfig
 * Headlines
 * Lualine
 * Markdown.nvim
 * Peek (requires deno)
 * Telescope
 * Treesitter (having treesitter-cli helps as well)
